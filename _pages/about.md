About me
======

Maura Pintor (female) is a Ph.D. Student at the University of Cagliari, Italy. 
She received the MSc degree in Telecommunications Engineering with honors in 
2018, from the University of Cagliari (Italy) discussing a graduation thesis 
titled \"A novel temporal descriptor for analyzing small and large crowds 
by computer vision algorithms\". Her research interests include adversarial 
machine learning and machine learning explainability methods, with 
applications in cybersecurity. She is co-author of the paper \"Why 
Do Adversarial Attacks Transfer? Explaining Transferability of Evasion 
and Poisoning Attacks\", recently accepted to USENIX 2019. She is 
currently collaborating with Pluribus One in the European Project 
[ALOHA](https://www.aloha-h2020.eu/), aimed to create a framework 
 for optimizing the design of Deep Learning systems on heterogeneous 
 low-energy computing platforms. Her contribution to the project 
 focuses on the security evaluation and mitigation strategies 
 against adversarial perturbations.
